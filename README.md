# TI_TE_wish
Calculating theoretical T1-weighted MRI images with arbitrary value of inversion time (TI) based on acquired Agilent MRI spin echo multi-slice experiment with inversion recovery (SEMS-IR) .fid data.

Calculating theoretical T2-weighted MRI images with arbitrary value of echo time (TE) based on acquired Agilent MRI multi-echo multi-slice (MEMS) .fid data.

The script can also be used for calculating T1, T2 and Mo maps without calculating theoretical images.


## The repository contains:
1. Python script **TI_TE_wish.py**.
2. Sample FID data in **sems_20190407_07.fid** and **mems_20190519_01.fid** folders.
3. Sample results in **Theoretical_MRI_T1w** and **Theoretical_MRI_T2w** folders.


Documentation coming soon.

**Swelling_tablet_fronts_D_k_from_MRI_T2_or_img** - Tool for characterizing the swelling of tablets immersed in a solution. Creates time plots and calculates eroding front's diffusion rate D and the rate of the swelling k from time series of either T2-maps or (properly contrasted, e.g. T2-weighted) MRI images in FDF (file format native for Agilent MRI scanners) or Text Image format. This software is suitable for swelling matrix tablets forming a membrane-like structure in contact with the solution in which they are immersed, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7262466 (https://github.com/BeataWereszczynska/Swelling_tablet_fronts_D_k_from_MRI_T2_or_img).
