# TI_TE_wish
Calculating theoretical T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI images with arbitrary value of inversion time (TI) based on previously acquired spin echo multi-slice experiment with inversion recovery (SEMS-IR) .fid (Agilent) data.

Calculating theoretical T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI images with arbitrary value of echo time (TE) based on previously acquired multi-echo multi-slice (MEMS) .fid (Agilent) data.

The script can also be used for calculating T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>0</sub> maps without calculating theoretical images.


## The repository contains:
1. Python script **TI_TE_wish.py**.
2. Sample FID data in **sems_20190407_07.fid** and **mems_20190519_01.fid** folders.
3. Sample results in **Theoretical_MRI_T1w** and **Theoretical_MRI_T2w** folders.


Documentation coming soon.
